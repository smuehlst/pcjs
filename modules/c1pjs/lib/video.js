/**
 * C1PVideo(parmsVideo, eCanvas, context, imgChars)
 *
 * The Video component can be configured with the following (parmsVideo) properties:
 *
 *      model: model number (one of: 540 or 600; 600 is the default)
 *      screenWidth: width of the screen window, in pixels
 *      screenHeight: height of the screen window, in pixels
 *      charCols: number of character columns
 *      charRows: number of character rows
 *      charWidth: width of charSet characters, in pixels (default is 0)
 *      charHeight: height of charSet characters, in pixels (default is 0)
 *      charSet: path to image (eg, PNG) file that defines the character set
 *      screenColor: background color of the screen window (default is black)
 *
 * The Video object assumes that the video buffer is organized such that offset 0 is mapped
 * to the left-most column and top-most row (col=0,row=0), offset 1 is (1,0), offset 2
 * is (2,0), and so on.
 *
 * The Video object initially contains no underlying video buffer; memory for the buffer
 * must be given to it by the Computer object.  We allocate a separate buffer, called
 * the screen buffer, into which we periodically copy the contents of the video buffer
 * via updateScreen(); any differences between the two buffers are then rendered in the
 * associated window, via updateWindow().
 *
 * When updateScreen() finds a byte in the screen buffer must be redisplayed, it converts
 * the offset of that byte into a (col,row) character position for the updateWindow() function,
 * which then converts (col,row) into (x,y) pixel offsets within the underlying canvas.
 *
 * Regarding the C1P (aka Model 600): The C1P has a 1K video buffer located at 0xD000-0xD3FF.
 * The ROM draws the initial "D/C/W/M ?" prompt at the "bottom" of the video buffer at location
 * 0xD365. That row really begins at 0xD360, but the C1P "indents" everything by 5 columns due
 * to the lack of a "guard band feature."  Similarly, BASIC defaults to a width of 24 columns
 * avoid display problems near the right edge.  BASIC will let you choose a width SMALLER than
 * 24 but not larger. So, while the video buffer supports a theoretical maximum of 32 rows x 32
 * columns, the practical maximum is 24 rows x 24 columns; the last 4 rows of the video buffer
 * are never used, and while content scrolls through the top 4 lines of the buffer, it is never
 * assumed that you can see the top 4 lines.
 *
 * This is partially confirmed by the "C1P Character Graphics Reference Manual", p3, which says
 * that the "the visible character field consists of 25 lines of 25 columns" and that the "first
 * visible character in the upper left of the screen is accessed via address 53379," or 0xD083,
 * confirming that the first 4 lines are not assumed to be visible.  However, the comment
 * regarding "25 lines of 25 columns" seems to be off by one in both dimensions.  And why would
 * they say that the first visible address is 0xD083 instead of 0xD085?  An indentation of 5 bytes,
 * rather than 3, would be more consistent with how the C1P ROMs use video memory.
 *
 * Model 540 Video Board vs. Model 600 "Superboard II"
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * This emulation was originally written for the Model 600 "Superboard II" (eg, Challenger 1P).
 * Support for the Model 540 video board (as used in the Challenger II-4P and II-8P) was added
 * later.
 *
 * NOTE: When Model 540 video emulation is enabled, Model 542 keyboard emulation must also be
 * enabled, because the former always came with the latter keyboard interface; this is why when
 * we call this.setModel(540), we must also notify the Keyboard via kbd.setModel(542).
 *
 * Key features/differences of the Model 540 video board include:
 *
 *      2K (8 pages) of video memory located at 0xD000-0xD7FF
 *      Two display modes: 32 rows x 64 cols (default on power up), and 32 rows x 32 cols
 *      64 bytes per screen row, regardless which display mode is selected
 *      The following options can be selected via WRITE to port address 0xDE00:
 *          Bit 0: clear to enable 32/64 mode (default on power up), set to enable 32/32
 *          Bit 1: 1=tone on (542 keyboard)
 *          Bit 2: 1=color on (Rev. B only?)
 *          bit 3: 1=enable 38-40Khz AC Home control output (Rev. B only?)
 *      Video timing counter status via READ from port address 0xDE00:
 *          Bit 7: 0 for 1/120 second, then 1 for 1/120 second, based on video clock (60Hz)
